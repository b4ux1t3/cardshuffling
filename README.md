# cardshuffling
Small project to better familiarize myself with ReactJS


## About this app:
This app creates 52 standard playing cards. It initially displays the cards in an orderly manner. When the user clicks the "Shuffle" button the cards will randomly shuffle and display the shuffled cards to the user.

##How to run locally:

Open a directory

Open a terminal and enter that directory

Assuming you have git, enter 'git clone https://github.com/rheechashaipu/cardshuffling.git'

Change directory to the cardshuffling folder. You'll have to cd twice to get to it. I know, I'm sorry for my poor folder management here.

Type, 'npm install' followed by 'npm start'

From here a browser window should open. Click the 'Shuffle' button to display a shuffled set of cards. Click 'Display ordered deck' to display a new and unshuffled deck.
